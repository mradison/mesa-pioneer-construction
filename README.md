# Mesa Pioneer Construction

This is a construction website.

## User Story

The general contractor wants a website that he can send customers to, so they can see his work and hopefully hire him as their contractor. 

## Acceptance Criteria

It is done when we have a fully functional website that users can use and enjoy. 

## Misc

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
